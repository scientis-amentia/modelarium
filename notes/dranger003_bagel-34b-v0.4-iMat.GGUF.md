## Notes
- iq2-xs
  - loads fine
  - runs quickly
  - no obvious prompt template issues
  - claims it can't generate code for ethical reasons
    - tried in a separate chat and it complied without complaint, so probably just a weird artifact of the chat context (which was a general 'hi! who are you and what can you do?' kind of chat)
