## Notes
- creation
  - no issues at the time BUT
  - it's doing that thing where the parsing of the quotes gets messed up and we get extraneous stop tokens in our output.
    - this had gone away; hopefully just a glitch

this is the modelfile for the model as Ollama sees it after `ollama create` and then `ollama show --modelfile mgmacleod/writing_partner_mistral_7b.Q4_0`

```
ollama show --modelfile mgmacleod/writing_partner_mistral_7b.Q4_0
# Modelfile generated by "ollama show"
# To build a new Modelfile based on this one, replace the FROM line with:
# FROM mgmacleod/writing_partner_mistral_7b.Q4_0:latest

```


notice the `PARAMETER stop "\"<|im_end|>\""` line. this is what's causing the issue with the quotes in our output. 



OOOOOHHHHHH it's the bloody blank line at the end of the file that needs to be there! make sure all modelfiles end with a newline character.
